<h1> Pharmacy4u website - ReadMe</h1>

![Responsiveness - Pharmacy4u](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181626573-3aeaf79a-c57d-45ff-8c83-b01c370bc551.jpg)


<p> 

I have created a pharmacy website (Pharmacy4u) that can be used by multiple pharmacies with simple modifications e.g. pharmacy name, logo, location details, etc. It gives basic background information about the pharmacy & enables the user to order prescriptions, book an online consultation & get some information about the pharmacy. I have designed it to be user friendly, visually appealing to the user & to create a positive emotional response by the user with a complimentary color palette & clickable buttons to name a few examples.  The site is targeted at current customers of the pharmacy who wish to improve their level of communication by ordering prescriptions or booking online consultations via the website & also prospective customers that may not be aware of the pharmacy, thus helping to improve it's online profile.  

The aim of the website is to:

- clearly indicate the purpose of the website to the user
- improve the online presence of the pharmacy by creating an interactive website
- enable the user to contact the pharmacy via for specific reasons e.g. order prescription, book consultation forms
- enable user to easily email the pharmacy by including a clickable email link in the footer
- utilise skills I have developed in learning two languages CSS & HTML. 
- have a simple layout the user can easily navigate
- include links to the pharmacies social media 

I plan to make the site accessible on a range of screen sizes for devices e.g. phone, tablet & PC/Laptop.

<h1>Features</h1>

<h3> Navigation Bar</h3>
    
<p>

I have made this easy to navigate between each page with a simple nav bar of four selections:
	
- Home
- About Us
- Prescriptions
- Book Consultation

	


![Pharmacy4u - Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181624487-16f6e240-5aa4-4de9-87c8-5fbb86c0c320.jpg)



I have ensured the nav bar that is consistent & intuitive among all of the pages to ensure continuity on the website. I have colored these in contrast to the background to make them stand out. I have also employed a hover function that underlines the link & signifies a call to action for the user.

</p>

<h3>Landing Page</h3>

I have used an image of tablets in a cup to convey to the user this website is a pharmacy website. I have used the zoom in function, like in the love running project, as I believe the dynamic image creates interest to the user making the website more appealing, which is vitally important on a landing page.


![Pharmacy4u - Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181624599-f87f7934-0ecd-450c-b4ec-e3ebc9bf5578.jpg)


I have created two styled, clickable buttons for ordering prescriptions & booking a consultation. I have made these very visible to convey to the user the purpose of the website & to improve navigation for the user. I have styled these & created an action when clicked to emulate pressing a button which I believe will create an emotional response of satisfaction, be it small, but still creating satisfaction to the user. 
	
I have created a fixed footer & a unfixed footer & will discuss later. 

</p>

<h3>About Us Section</h3>

<p>
I have written a short paragraph detailing the owner of the pharmacy, their experience & where the pharmacy is located. This is to give the user some insight into the owner of the pharmacy & create trust in using the pharmacy. 
	
I have created the "About Us" page that gives the user information about the pharmacy. 

</p>

<h3>Prescriptions</h3>

<p> 
This section enables the user to fill out a form to request a prescription from the pharmacy. The user must fill out their credentials name, phone number, email address & comments/details. It also allows the user to inform the pharmacy if it is a prescription they retain on file or if it is a new prescription it offers the user the ability to upload a picture of the prescription to the pharmacy.  I have used the "required" attribute to ensure the necessary information is filled in before user submits form. I have styled the form & the submit button to remain consistent with the color scheme of the website  

![Pharmacy4u - Order Prescriptions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181717684-cce8b8bb-4ecb-46a2-a672-f02f084470ce.jpg)
	

</p>

<h3>Book Consultation</h3>

<p> 

This section enables the user to fill out a form to request a consultation from the pharmacy. I have included a few common ailments a pharmacist would normally advise on but have also included an "other" section with a input to allow "free typing" if the user wishes to book consultation for another reason not listed. Again the user must fill out their credentials name, phone number, email address & comments/details.

</p>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

I decided on Roboto Condensed & Sans-Serif as complimentary fonts for the headings & main body of the site. I chose these fonts as they are readable & clean for the user. I used Italianno for the H3 heading for the tag line for the pharmacy "where good health begins" as I thought it gave the tag line more character & meaning to the user.

<h3>Footer</h3>

I have created a fixed footer at the bottom of all the pages that informs the user of the pharmacy opening times & contact details, phone & email address. I chose to have this as a fixed footer as I find in many pharmacy website the user has to search for basic information like opening times & contact details. I felt this would positively add to the user experience as the user could easily find the required information.  This could easily be modified to include more information by expanding the footer if required.  I have created a clickable link on the email address wo the user can easily email the pharmacy/website, again improving the user experience by ensuring an intuitive website structure that is easily navigated.

![Pharmacy4u - Footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181711180-37c0dc48-919a-49b0-9318-99b847408aee.jpg)

In the "About Us" section/page I have created a footer with social media links

![Social Media Footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181711668-500c2b92-d8fd-450e-b200-647ba5e517d8.jpg)

This links the user to the pharmacy website's social media. I have used the target attribute "_blank" to open link in a new tab to increase the likelihood of the user to remain on the Pharmacy4u website. I have also included a link to the pharmacy location by clicking the map icon along side the social media links. (I have used St Gabriel's Pharmacy, Clontarf, as the location in this example website.)   

<h3>Favicon & Page Headings</h3>

![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181719310-6dae9e23-bdc7-4716-91ba-7917ca5639d9.jpg)

I have used a green cross to convey a pharmacy website, which allows the user to find the website easier if they have multiple tabs open in their browser. I have given each subpage the same favicon & headings to match the page the user is on e.g. prescriptions, book consultation or about us.

<h1>Validation</h1>

I used the W3 Validator to ensure there were no errors in my HTML final code. I found this tool very useful throughout the process as it highlighted when I had made an error e.g. left a tag open or duplicated a CSS rule.  I found it important to do this on a regular basis to ensure any errors where addressed in a timely manner. I plan to use these validation tools throughout my software development training & beyond as it helps me to ensure I write clean code with no errors. 

![W3 Validator - Index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181722905-712943a6-599e-48fd-99be-8e384a6a6b4f.jpg)

I used the W3C CSS Validation Service to ensure my CSS was error free. I performed this multiple times as I found it useful in pointing out errors before & after commiting changes on Gitpod.

I used web.dev to access the quality & accessibility of the webpage. It gave me insight into how the pharmacy4u website & scored highly in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices & SEO

<h1>Bugs</h1>

<b> Background images would not load - </b> after deploying my project to github the background images wouldn't load due to having used absolute file paths. I used "/images/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4210656.jpg" instead of "../images/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4210656.jpg". Using "../" remedied this issue.

<b>Media Query Issue with fixed footer -</b>  The footer width was greater than the rest of the pages when I reduced screen size down to <1024px. After discussing with some colleagues on Slack I discovered my issue was a padding-right issue on the menu. I removed the padding to the right & this resolved the issue 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181733137-15f916ff-f7d1-455f-8556-e120e5d4b1d8.png)

<b>Background Image with zoom function overflowing - </b> I fixed this by creating an outer for each image & used the "overflow: hidden;" attribute.

<b>Book Consultation & Order Prescriptions Button zoomed with the background image - </b> I had created a div without closing tag. Closed div 

<b>Menu items in wrong order when screen size <480px - </b> the Home link was last in the list & I wanted it top of the list. After discussion with my colleagues on slack I added the "flex-direction: column-reverse;" attribute, which fixed the bug
	
<b>Git push issue after editing readme file - </b> Error occured when I had edited readme file on github & due to different versions of file on github & gitpod I could not push or commit any changes. 
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181737995-4d110db3-c57c-4a70-9ed8-a87433388f88.png)
	
I found the following tutorial helpful (https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/merge-conflicts-in-git) & used git pull function to merge version & fix error. 

During the project I discovered the importance of git commit & git push & how I could revert back to previous versions if necessary. This is a practice I plan to use as I develop my skills as a software developer.

I have also used a mixture of measurements Px / EM / % in this project & feel it best practice moving forward to use one unit of measurement where possible. I discovered when creating media queries that EM & % is best used for sizing as Px are an absolute unit of measure & not used as best practice in this scenario.
